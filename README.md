# BlindRumble
A once-popular mod just barely made to work after the Cosmetic update. MadLike, the original owner, no longer makes mods for RUMBLE. 
This mod was revolutionary for its time, with a complete overhaul of the graphics to a sonar-based syste. It was a fun gameplay mix-up, and the fact that this mod is what originally got me into modding means it holds a special place in my heart.
